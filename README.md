## Expectation

- This version of the tool misses some features from the latest one. This is expected.
- Treat this version of the tool as a more efficient way of exploring different 
game archives and sound banks and exporting metadata.
- The missing features will be ported to this version of the tool. However, 
features that are focus on exploration and metadata export will have a higher 
priority.

## Report Bugs

- This version of the tool is actively under development. Please report bugs as 
there's one.
